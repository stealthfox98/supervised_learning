# Non-payment prediction model

This project aims to create a process flow that...
1. Cleans the input data
2. Builds a new dataset with useful features
3. Creation, training and testing of models
4. Performance metrics for model comparison

with which the user can choose the best fit for non-payment prediction.

## Potential of machine learning usage in the financial sector

* Credit granting is, by far, the most important activity of the banking system: financial institutions receive loan payments from individuals and businesses, along with interest.
* There is an underlying risk in lending money, as there is a chance of a debtor in failing to repay.
* This risk is managed with the help of outputs generated by credit score models.
* ML models can accurately predict the probability of a customer defaulting.
